# Java CI/CD Pipeline Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Maven, Docker, Ansible, and Kubernetes. The pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying a Java-based web application.

## Infrastructure Setup
The project is implemented on the following infrastructure:
- **Jenkins Server**: Manages the CI/CD pipeline
- **Ansible Controller**: Orchestrates deployment across multiple servers
- **Testing Servers (2 nodes)**: Hosts for running automated tests
- **Kubernetes Cluster**:
  - **Master Node**: Manages the cluster
  - **Worker Nodes (2 nodes)**: Runs the deployed application

## CI/CD Pipeline Workflow

1. **Source Code Management**
   - The Java application source code is stored in a GitHub repository.

2. **Build and Artifact Creation**
   - Jenkins pulls the latest source code from the repository.
   - Maven is used to build the application and generate an artifact.

3. **Containerization with Docker**
   - A Dockerfile is created dynamically within Jenkins.
   - The base image is Tomcat, and the generated artifact is copied into the container.
   - Jenkins triggers a Docker build command to create a customized Docker image.
   - The image is pushed to a container registry.

4. **Automated Testing**
   - The image is deployed to multiple QA servers using an Ansible playbook.
   - Selenium scripts stored in the GitHub repository are executed to test the application.

5. **Deployment to Kubernetes**
   - After successful testing, the image is deployed to a production Kubernetes cluster.
   - Kubernetes YAML definition files are used to deploy and expose the application.
   - Jenkins triggers these Kubernetes configurations via SSH.

## Technologies Used
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Build Tools**: Maven
- **CI/CD Tool**: Jenkins
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Testing**: Selenium

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline for a Java-based application, from code commit to production deployment using modern DevOps tools. It ensures automation, efficiency, and scalability in software delivery.
